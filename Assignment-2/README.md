Write a program that implements a slow [𝑶(𝒏𝟐)] sort method and a fast [𝑶(𝒏𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒏)] sort method. Experiment with your program by running your sort methods using 𝒏 random numbers as inputs for 𝒏 = 𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎,𝒏 = 𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎,𝒏 = 𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎. Compare the running times by implementing the timer function of the language you are using. (Bonus) Use Binary Search on sorted data for each 𝒏 and report run times. (You may search a random value in the range you are using)
